Welcome to GPflux
==================

GPflux is a research toolbox dedicated to Deep Gaussian processes (DGP) :cite:p:`damianou2013deep`, the hierarchical extension of Gaussian processes (GP) created by feeding the output of one GP into the next.

GPflux uses the mathematical building blocks from `GPflow <http://www.gpflow.org/>`_ :cite:p:`gpflow2020` and marries these with the powerful layered deep learning API provided by `Keras <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras>`_.
This combination leads to a framework that can be used for:

- researching (deep) Gaussian process models (e.g., :cite:p:`salimbeni2017doubly, dutordoir2018cde, salimbeni2019iwvi`), and
- building, training, evaluating and deploying (deep) Gaussian processes in a modern way, making use of the tools developed by the deep learning community.


Getting started
---------------

We have provided multiple `Tutorials <tutorials>` showing the basic functionality of the toolbox, and have a comprehensive `API Reference <autoapi/gpflux/index>`.

As a quick teaser, here's a snippet from the `intro notebook <notebooks/intro>` that demonstrates how a two-layer DGP is built and trained with GPflux for a simple one-dimensional dataset:


.. code-block:: python

   # Layer 1
   Z = np.linspace(X.min(), X.max(), X.shape[0] // 2).reshape(-1, 1)
   kernel1 = gpflow.kernels.SquaredExponential()
   inducing_variable1 = gpflow.inducing_variables.InducingPoints(Z.copy())
   gp_layer1 = gpflux.layers.GPLayer(
      kernel1, inducing_variable1, num_data=X.shape[0], num_latent_gps=X.shape[1]
   )

   # Layer 2
   kernel2 = gpflow.kernels.SquaredExponential()
   inducing_variable2 = gpflow.inducing_variables.InducingPoints(Z.copy())
   gp_layer2 = gpflux.layers.GPLayer(
      kernel2,
      inducing_variable2,
      num_data=X.shape[0],
      num_latent_gps=X.shape[1],
      mean_function=gpflow.mean_functions.Zero(),
   )

   # Initialise likelihood and build model
   likelihood_layer = gpflux.layers.LikelihoodLayer(gpflow.likelihoods.Gaussian(0.1))
   two_layer_dgp = gpflux.models.DeepGP([gp_layer1, gp_layer2], likelihood_layer)

   # Compile and fit
   model = two_layer_dgp.as_training_model()
   model.compile(tf.optimizers.Adam(0.01))
   history = model.fit({"inputs": X, "targets": Y}, epochs=int(1e3), verbose=0)

The model described above produces the fit shown in Fig 1. For comparison, in Fig. 2 we show the fit on the same dataset by a vanilla single-layer GP model.
