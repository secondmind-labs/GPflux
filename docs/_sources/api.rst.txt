   DO NOT REMOVE! This file contains the `autosummary` directive, without which API documentation won't
   get extracted from docstrings by the `sphinx.ext.autosummary` engine. It is hidden (not declared in
   any toctree) to remove an unnecessary intermediate page; index.rst instead points directly to the 
   package page. DO NOT REMOVE!
