    "This notebook demonstrates how to approximate an exact Gaussian process regression model (GPR) with random Fourier features in weight space. The end result is Figure 1 from from Wilson et al. \"Efficiently sampling functions from Gaussian process posteriors\" <cite data-cite=\"wilson2020efficiently\"/>. This figure demonstrates that approximating an exact GPR model in weight space becomes increasingly more difficult as the training data grows. While the approximation remains accurate in areas within the training data and far away from the training data, predictions close to the training data points (but outside the training data interval) become less reliable. Note that Wilson et al. provide a method to alleviate exactly this problem; however, this is outside the scope of this notebook, where the emphasis is on how to build a weight space approximated Gaussian process model with random Fourier features in `gpflux`.\n",

    "The basic idea is to approximate a stationary kernel $k(X,X^\\prime)$ for one-dimensional inputs $X \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $X^\\prime \\in \\mathbb{R}$ according to Bochner's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k(X, X^\\prime) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^I \\phi_i(X) \\phi_i(X^\\prime),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $I$ Fourier features $\\phi_i$  following Rahimi and Recht \"Random features for large-scale kernel machines\" (NeurIPS, 2007) defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi_i(X) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma^2}{l}} \\cos(\\theta_i X + \\tau_i),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma^2$ refers to the kernel variance and $l$ to the kernel lengthscale. $\\theta_i$ and $\\tau_i$ are randomly drawn hyperparameters that determine each feature function $\\phi_i$. The hyperparameter $\\theta_i$ is randomly drawn from the kernel's spectral density. The spectral density of a stationary kernel is obtained by interpreting the kernel as a function of one argument only (i.e. the distance between $X$ and $X^\\prime$) and performing a Fourier transform on that function, resulting in an unnormalised probability density (from which samples can be obtained). The hyperparameter $\\tau_i$ is obtained by sampling from a uniform distribution $\\tau_i \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,2\\pi)$. Note that both $\\theta_i$ and $\\tau_i$ are fixed and not optimised over. An interesting direction of future research is how to automatically identify those (but this is outside the scope of this notebook). If we drew infinitely many samples, i.e. $I \\rightarrow \\infty$, we would recover the true kernel perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel approximation specified above enables you to express a supervised inference problem with training data $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(X_n,y_n)\\}_{n=1,...,N}$ in weight space view as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\textbf{w} | \\mathcal{D}) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^N p(y_n| \\textbf{w}^\\intercal \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(X_n), \\sigma_\\epsilon^2) p(\\textbf{w})}{p(\\mathcal{D})},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where we assume $p(\\textbf{w})$ to be a standard normal multivariate prior and $p(y_n| \\textbf{w}^\\intercal \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(X_n), \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)$ to be a univariate Gaussian observation model of the i.i.d. likelihood with mean $\\textbf{w}^\\intercal \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(X_n)$ and noise variance $\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$. The boldface notation $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(X_n)$ refers to the vector-valued feature function that evaluates all features from $1$ up to $I$ for one particular input $X_n$. Under these assumptions, the posterior $p(\\textbf{w} | \\mathcal{D})$ enjoys a closed form and is Gaussian. Predictions can readily be obtained by sampling $\\textbf{w}$ and evaluating the function sample $\\textbf{w}$ at new locations $\\{X_{n^\\star}^\\star\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$ as $\\{\\textbf{w}^\\intercal \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(X_{n^\\star}^\\star)\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of expressing a Gaussian process in weight space is that functions are represented as weight vectors $\\textbf{w}$ (rather than actual functions $f(\\cdot)$) from which samples can be obtained a priori without knowing where the function should be evaluated. When expressing a Gaussian process in function space view the latter is not possible, i.e. a function $f(\\cdot)$ cannot be sampled without knowing where to evaluate the function, namely at $\\{X_{n^\\star}^\\star\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$. Weight space approximated Gaussian processes therefore hold the potential to sample efficiently from Gaussian process posteriors, which is desirable in vanilla supervised learning but also in domains such as Bayesian optimisation or model-based reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we compare a weight space approximated GPR model (WSA model) with both a proper GPR model and a sparse variational Gaussian Process model (SVGP). GPR models and SVGP models are implemented in `gpflow`, but the two necessary ingredients for building the WSA model are part of `gpflux`: these are random Fourier feature functions via the `RandomFourierFeaturesCosine` class, and approximate kernels based on Bochner's theorem (or any other theorem that approximates a kernel with a finite number of feature functions, e.g. Mercer) via the `KernelWithFeatureDecomposition` class."

    "The results are visualised in a 2 $\\times$ 3 plot with 6 subplots. The first row refers to experiments with few training data points and the second row to experiments with many training data points. The first column depicts the exact GPR model in green, the second column the SVGP model in purple and the third column the WSA model in orange. In each plot, training data points are marked in grey (as vertical bars in the first row and fill plots in the second row). We also assume the GPR model's prediction as ground truth, which is therefore plotted in all plots as black dashed lines (indicating mean +/- 2 * std).\n",

    "In each plot, the model's prediction in terms of mean +/- 2 * std is plotted through fill plots, and function samples from the (approximate) posterior through thin solid lines (thick solid lines depict mean functions in the second and third column). Note that the coloured purple circles in the second column refer to predictions at the inducing point locations of the SVGP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that, as training data points increase from the first to the second row, the predictions of the WSA model decrease drastically in areas relevant to extrapolation (i.e. close to but not inside the training data interval) because a lot of Fourier features would be required to accurately approximate a function sample drawn from a Matern kernel (because of its non-smooth nature). The same effect would be less severe for a function sample drawn from an RBF kernel that is smoother than a Matern kernel (and can hence be reliably approximated with fewer Fourier features). Note that the experiment is stochastic because the ground truth function sample from the prior kernel is random. There might be outcomes of the experiment in which the explained effect is less prominent than in other random outcomes -- so the last code block might require execution more than once to obtain a clear result."
